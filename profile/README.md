# Non Phy Research

**Non Phy Research** is an independent scientific organization focused on epistemically structured theories of physics.

We investigate falsifiability as a formal structure, symbolic coherence as a methodological pillar, and ontological models that challenge current paradigms.

The project originated with the creation of **Non Phy v5**, a foundational theory developed through decades of private analysis, and formally registered as a falsifiable, testable framework.

## 🔷 Core Concepts

- Ontological physics and symbolic formalism
- Karl Popper's falsifiability as structural logic
- Rejection of metaphysical interpretation in favor of epistemic causality
- Meta-layered system of:
  - `ONTO-000-000-000` – ontologies  
     Foundational conceptual structures representing the nature of entities, their relationships, and causal ontological status within the theory. Ontologies define what "exists" and how.

  - `THEO-000-000-000` – theories  
     Coherent theoretical systems built on ontologies, each governed by equations, testable assumptions, and falsifiability pathways. Each `THEO` references specific `EQUA`, `FATE`, and `ONTO`.

  - `EQUA-000-000-000` – equations  
     Core mathematical expressions of the theory. Each equation encodes symbolic dynamics, constraints, or transformations, and must pass falsifiability conditions.

  - `FATE-000-000-000` – falsifiability tests  
     Independent tests that attempt to falsify specific equations or entire theories. May include experimental proposals, simulations, or derived consequences that can be confronted with data.

  - `MATH-000-000-000` – mathematical derivations  
     Formal deductions, symbolic manipulations, or transformations used to derive or support `EQUA` or internal consistency. MATH entries ensure logical rigor before empirical evaluation.

  - `EXPM-000-000-000` – experimental validation using existing data  
     Validation tests based on **already available datasets or published results**. These are **non-speculative** and aim to compare the predictions of Non Phy with real, historical experimental data (e.g. spectroscopy, decay rates, time dilation curves).

  - `EXPP-000-000-000` – proposed experimental setups  
     **New experimental proposals** created to directly test ontological hypotheses, falsifiability paths, or predicted phenomena not yet measured. May include quantum configurations, interferometry, vibrational coherence setups, or untested predictions in high-energy physics.

  - `EXPP-000-000-000` – proposed experimental setups  
     **New experimental proposals** created to directly test ontological hypotheses, falsifiability paths, or predicted phenomena not yet measured. May include quantum configurations, interferometry, vibrational coherence setups, or untested predictions in high-energy physics.

  - `CONS-000-000-000` - constants
     Fundamental values derived from causal mechanisms within the theory, eschewing arbitrary postulates to align with a vision of causally grounded physics.

  - `EMER-000-000-000` - emergent theoretical clusters
     High-level thematic groupings of theories (THEO-000-000-000) that share causal coherence, domain focus, and ontological lineage. Each EMER defines a unifying conceptual layer through which several THEO, EQUA, and ONTO interact as a structured epistemic frontier.
