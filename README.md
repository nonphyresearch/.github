# Non Phy Research

**Non Phy Research** is an independent scientific organization focused on epistemically structured theories of physics.

We investigate falsifiability as a formal structure, symbolic coherence as a methodological pillar, and ontological models that challenge current paradigms.

The project originated with the creation of **Non Phy v5**, a foundational theory developed through decades of private analysis, and formally registered as a falsifiable, testable framework.

## üî∑ Core Concepts

- Ontological physics and symbolic formalism
- Karl Popper's falsifiability as structural logic
- Rejection of metaphysical interpretation in favor of epistemic causality
- Meta-layered system of:
  - `ONTO###` ‚Äì ontologies  
  - `THEO###` ‚Äì theories  
  - `EQUA###` ‚Äì equations  
  - `FATE###` ‚Äì falsifiability tests  
  - `MATH###`, `EXPM###`, `EXPP###` ‚Äì validation units
  - `ONTO###` ‚Äì ontologies  
     Foundational conceptual structures representing the nature of entities, their relationships, and causal ontological status within the theory. Ontologies define what "exists" and how.

  - `THEO###` ‚Äì theories  
     Coherent theoretical systems built on ontologies, each governed by equations, testable assumptions, and falsifiability pathways. Each `THEO` references specific `EQUA`, `FATE`, and `ONTO`.

  - `EQUA###` ‚Äì equations  
     Core mathematical expressions of the theory. Each equation encodes symbolic dynamics, constraints, or transformations, and must pass falsifiability conditions.

  - `FATE###` ‚Äì falsifiability tests  
     Independent tests that attempt to falsify specific equations or entire theories. May include experimental proposals, simulations, or derived consequences that can be confronted with data.

  - `MATH###` ‚Äì mathematical derivations  
     Formal deductions, symbolic manipulations, or transformations used to derive or support `EQUA` or internal consistency. MATH entries ensure logical rigor before empirical evaluation.

  - `EXPM###` ‚Äì experimental validation using existing data  
     Validation tests based on **already available datasets or published results**. These are **non-speculative** and aim to compare the predictions of Non Phy with real, historical experimental data (e.g. spectroscopy, decay rates, time dilation curves).

  - `EXPP###` ‚Äì proposed experimental setups  
     **New experimental proposals** created to directly test ontological hypotheses, falsifiability paths, or predicted phenomena not yet measured. May include quantum configurations, interferometry, vibrational coherence setups, or untested predictions in high-energy physics.
